# Blockchain Simulation for Market Events

This module implements a simplified blockchain-style consensus mechanism
to order market events under network delay and possible forks.

The goal is to explore how a longest-chain rule can be used to achieve
eventual consistency in a distributed market simulation.

This implementation is inspired by concepts from distributed consensus
and blockchain protocols, focusing on clarity rather than completeness.
